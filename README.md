# ReactCalculator
A calculator made using React

Easy to use as long as you've used a calculator before!

```
> git clone https://github.com/TheOmegaBlack/TicReacToe.git
> cd ReactCalculator
> npm install
> npm start
> go to localhost:8080 on your browser (you can change it by adding "devServer: {port: YOURPORT}," to webpack.config.js. Write the port number you want instead of YOURPORT. )
```
That's it!
